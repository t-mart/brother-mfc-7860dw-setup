# Brother MFC-7860DW Printer/Scanner Setup

![The Brother MFC-7860DW Printer/Scanner](docs/images/printer.png)

I have a Brother MFC-7860DW printer/scanner. I bought it 2011-08-28 and its a trusty piece of
hardware that I want to use for years to come. The subscription-ification and DRM of newer printers
scares me.

In this repository, I document some aspects of setting it up in a way I like.

## Scanning Setup

See [Scanning](docs/scanning.md).

## Printing Setup
