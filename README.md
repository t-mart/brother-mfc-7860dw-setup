# Brother MFC-7860DW Printer/Scanner FTP Server

I have a scanner, the Brother MFC-7860DW, and I want an easy way to scan files from it to my
computer.

The goal of this repository is to:

- Provide an application that enables "easy" scanning. Specifically, provide a docker container that
  runs an FTP server, which can then be targetted by the printer. Further, the solution must be able
  to do the following:

  - Contain no proprietary software that may stop working one day.
  - Put files immediately on your system.
  - Can be driven entirely from the the printer. Otherwise, you're running back and forth to the
    computer to start additional scans or to the printer to load more documents.
  - Offer PDF and JPEG outputs.

- Document (with this readme) the setup, so it can be reproduced. I've done this so many times over
  the years, and always forget a detail or two when setting up a new computer or after installation
  of my OS.

I bought this printer 2011-08-28, and it's still a solid machine that I hope to use for years to
come. The subscription-ification and DRM of newer printers scares me.

## Implementation

- A Docker Compose application that specifies:
  - An FTP server with a decent level of configurability, logging, and security.
    - The server is based off of
      [markhobson/docker-vsftpd.git](https://github.com/markhobson/docker-vsftpd.git), with some
      quality of life improvements.
  - Bind mounting of the FTP server's file storage to a convenient directory on my filesystem.
  - A restart policy of `unless-stopped`. This has Docker bring the application automatically up if
    I restart my my computer.
- Firewall rule (for Windows) that permits the incoming connection from the printer.

## Steps

1. Clone this repo (and get the git submodule that contains the dockerized vsftpd):

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/t-mart/printer-ftp-server.git
   cd printer-ftp-server/
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   ```

2. Save the username and password of the FTP server in a file in the build context of the server
   image:

   **Note to self: I keep these in my password manager under
   `Brother Printer FTP Account to Desktop`**

   ```shell
   cp docker-vsftpd/virtual_users.template.txt docker-vsftpd/virtual_users.txt
   vi docker-vsftpd/virtual_users.txt  # edit in vi
   ```

   Make sure to follow the format:

   ```text
   username
   password
   ```

   (You can even add more users if you want. Just add more pairs of username/password lines.)

3. Ensure the volume bind source (i.e. the directory it points to) in `docker-compose.yml` exists on
   the host system. Default is `C:\Users\tim\Desktop\scans`. Update it if not.

4. Run this docker compose service:

   ```shell
   docker compose up --detach --build --always-recreate-deps  # or simply `make up` if you have make
   ```

5. Create a firewall rule like the following:

   ![firewall rule](docs/firewall-rule.gif)

   The main parts are:

   - Protocols and Ports tab
     - Protocols and Ports section
       - Protocol Type: `TCP`
       - Local port: `Specific Ports` and `20, 21, 21100-21110` (20 is for FTP data, 21 is for FTP
         control, 21100-21110 are for passive mode.)
   - Scope tab
     - Remote IP address section
       - `These IP addresses:`
         - `192.168.1.0/24`, or whatever an appropriate CIDR subnet block would be for the network.

6. Find the printer's IP address on the network. This information can be found on the printer itself
   through the LCD display:

   1. Press the `Menu` button.
   2. Press the down arrow until you reach `6. Network`. Press the `OK` button.
   3. Press the down arrow until you reach `2. WLAN`. Press the `OK` button.
   4. The first option should be `TCP/IP`, which is what we want. Press the `OK` button.
   5. Press the down arrow until you reach `2. IP Address`. Press the `OK` button.
   6. Record the displayed IP address.

7. Navigate to that IP address in a browser. Then, in the navigational menu, go to:

   1. Administrator Settings
   2. FTP Scan Profile

   **Note to self: If the administrator username/password are asked for, use the values I keep in my
   password manager under `Brother Printer Admin`**

   Then, if no profiles exist, create a few. Profiles can be selected in the "Scan to FTP" menu on
   the printer and specify some properties of the scan, such as DPI, file type, etc.

   ![profile](docs/profile.png)

   Common Parameters:

   - Host Address: IP of my computer (find with `ipconfig`)
   - Username: username from step #2
   - Password: password from step #2
   - Store Directory: `/`
   - Passive Mode: `On`
   - Port Number: `21`

   Profile-specific Parameters:

   - Document scanning:

     - Profile Name: `document`
     - File Name: `scan`
     - Quality: `Color 200`
     - File Type: `PDF`
     - File Size: `Middle`

   - Hi-Res Document scanning:

     - Profile Name: `document-hi-res`
     - File Name: `scan`
     - Quality: `Color 600`
     - File Type: `PDF`
     - File Size: `Large`

   - Photo scanning:

     - Profile Name: `photo`
     - File Name: `scan`
     - Quality: `Color 600`
     - File Type: `PDF`
     - File Size: `Large`

8. Do a test scan to ensure it works. ðŸ¤ž
